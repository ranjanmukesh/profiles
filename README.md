# Profiles 🦀⛓️

**A Solana on-chain program for managing user profiles, built with Anchor (Rust).**

This repository contains the complete code for the Solana program described in my DEV.to article:  
**["Lessons from building a Solana project using iPhone"](https://dev.to/mukesh-ranjan-dev/lessons-from-building-a-solana-project-using-iphone-2ck3)**  

The article shares the full story of developing and deploying this exact program **entirely from an iPhone** (using the *ish* app for Alpine Linux emulation, external keyboard, Codeberg for version control, and Forgejo Actions for CI/CD) — after losing access to laptops due to hardware failures.

It serves as a proof-of-concept for mobile-first, constraint-driven blockchain development using free/open tools.

### Future Plans
This "Profiles" program is the foundational piece.  
I plan to **extend the app significantly** in a **separate follow-up project** (e.g., adding client-side integration, frontend, more advanced features like social profiles, verification, or cross-chain elements).  
That extension will live in its own repository — stay tuned for updates!
